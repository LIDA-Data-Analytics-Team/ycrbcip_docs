# LASER Biscom: A Secure File Transfer guide

This guide is to help staff working on the Yorkshire Cancer Research Bowel Cancer Improvement Programme (YCRBCIP) transfer files to and from the University of Leeds secure IT platform, called LASER. Files can be transferred to and from LASER using our Secure File Transfer service, called LASER Biscom.

If you need any help using Biscom, you can email the LIDA Data Analytics Team (DAT) for support at [dat@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:dat@leeds.ac.uk).
